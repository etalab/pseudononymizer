# A Simple Keras (UKP BiLSTM + CRF) pseudonymization REST 'API'

## Description
This repository contains the code for starting a REST PoC pseudonymizing service. 

Pseudonymization here means finding certain identifiying entities within a text and replacing them with a token. For example, we may replace first and last names with a chain of characters ("..." or "XXXXX") such that *Mr. Jean PARMENTIER* becomes *Mr. ... ...* 

In order to find said entities, we train a supervised structured model. This task is more generally known as named entity recognition. 

This project is based on two main building blocks:
1.  The algorithm used to train the supervised model is the now classic biLSTM+CRF. The implementation used is that from [the UKP lab](https://github.com/UKPLab/emnlp2017-bilstm-cnn-crf). To train your own model for this application, you may  employ the fork created [here](https://github.com/psorianom/emnlp2017-bilstm-cnn-crf).  Sample, fake data is available overthere to train a model. Also, a training script is also ready to be used to do start the process. Still, we recommend you to use your own annotated  set to get better results. 


2. Once the model trained, and saved in the right position (in the */models* folder), we base our REST service on the code from [*Building a simple Keras + deep learning REST API*](https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html).

This code is absolutely _not_ meant to be production-level and capable of scaling under heavy load.

## Getting started

The easiest way to start this service is by using docker and the associated Dockerfile in this repo. Assuming docker is installed, the only thing to do is:

Building the docker image:
```sh
$ docker build -t pseudonym_api:latest .
```

Next, initializing said image:

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 5001:5001 pseudonym_api:latest
```


## Submitting requests to the Keras server

Requests can be submitted via cURL:

```sh
$ curl -X POST -F text='M Soriano habite à Paris' 'http://localhost:5001/tag'
{
   "pseudonim_text":"M \u2026 habite \u00e0 Paris",
   "success":true,
   "tagged_text":"M [B-PER]Soriano[/B-PER] habite \u00e0 Paris"
}
```

Programmatically:

```sh
$ python simple_request.py 
M … habite à Paris
```

Or as a test, via the web page ```example_form.html``` in the site/ folder.
